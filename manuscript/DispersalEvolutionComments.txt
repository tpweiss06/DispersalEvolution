Comments from lab meeting

- Transition from range expansion to range shifts could be clearer with the explanation of range expansion vs. range shift

- last sentence of first paragraph makes it feel like I'm going to only be talking about range expansions

- Could also read like I'm building up to shifts from expansions. Need to really clarify expansion vs. shifts

- Clarify that the goal is does dispersal evolution keep up with climate change

- Maybe refocus introduction to be more about range shifts and climate change and bring in range expansions later as purely a baseline.

- potential framing (we're interested in shifts and to understand what happend we think about expansions)

- Keep the narrative a bit more focused on climate change and that big important question

- offer more precise definitions up front (e.g. edge populations)

- clearer description of problem in lines 30 ish

- clarifying the relationship of the current study to previous research

- take more time to introduce the factors we vary in the model

- maybe use the phrase "efficiency of selection" to describe the issue

- clarify the phrasing for "two species of wood crickets and the speckled wood butterfly"

- Lines 72-77 can be confusing based on the relationship between shifts and expansions

- maybe put more of the simulation experiment/description after the model description with a clear description of why it's set up in that way

- explain "dispersal phenotype" earlier in the model 

- remind people that parentage is assigned from patch and clarify line 90 sentence

- add in the details of "stochastic reproduction"

- In line 104, "inheritence of loci" should be "inheritence of alleles"

- In line 105, say what section instead of "described below"

- Maybe a bit more justification for not considering environmental stochasticity (or just not mention environmental stochasticity)

- Make sure Beta is clearly defined as a function of t

- Define sigma L in the dispersal section
