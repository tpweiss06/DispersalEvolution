Comments from lab meeting

- offer more precise definitions up front (e.g. edge populations)

- take more time to introduce the factors we vary in the model

- maybe use the phrase "efficiency of selection" to describe the issue

- maybe put more of the simulation experiment/description after the model description with a clear description of why it's set up in that way

- explain "dispersal phenotype" earlier in the model 

- remind people that parentage is assigned from patch and clarify line 90 sentence

- add in the details of "stochastic reproduction"

- In line 104, "inheritence of loci" should be "inheritence of alleles"

- In line 105, say what section instead of "described below"

- Maybe a bit more justification for not considering environmental stochasticity (or just not mention environmental stochasticity)

- Make sure Beta is clearly defined as a function of t

- Define sigma L in the dispersal section
