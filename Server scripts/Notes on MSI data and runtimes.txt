		Notes on MSI data usage and run times

- Running 100 simulations of haploid organisms with 6 different numbers of loci:
	STORAGE
	- 1.1 Gb for the Equilibrium matrices
	- 3.7 Gb for the Expansion simulations 
	- 1.9 Gb for the Shift simulations 
	TIME
	- 4 hours for the Equilibrium simualtions 
	- 1.25 hours for the Expansion simulations 
	- 0.25 hours for the Shift simulations 
	- 0.75 hours for extracting the Expansion data
	- 0.25 hours for extracting the Shift data
