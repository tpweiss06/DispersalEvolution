These simulations represent the same model as I presented at ESA (i.e. no significant alterations). I just ran each type of simulation for 1,000 realizations to try and get a cleaned up, accurate assessment of the dynamics. 

The code was run on MSI in the last few months of 2019 (i.e. the before times). My folder on MSI still has the scripts used.
